# Phase C Forensic Audit: Synchronizing Stencil-Matrix to Global Foundation

# Rule 7 (Scientific Truth): The simulation is iterating, but the 'Snapshots' 
# are being taken from the global state which isn't being updated by the blocks.

# 1. Inject the Global Archivist call at the end of the time-step loop
# This ensures that for every iteration, Step 5 captures the state of the Foundation.
# sed -i "/state.time +=/a \                # Rule 6 & 9: Global State Snapshot\n                from src.step5.orchestrate_step5 import orchestrate_step5\n                orchestrate_step5(state)" src/main_solver.py

# 2. Fix a potential 'Elasticity' vs 'State' mismatch (Rule 4 SSoT)
# Ensure the loop uses the state's time increment to maintain sync with the archivist
# sed -i "s/state.time += elasticity.dt/state.time += state.dt/g" src/main_solver.py

# 3. Add a debug print to track if the loop is actually executing more than 0 iterations
